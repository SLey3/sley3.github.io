            <p>
                - No variety of hair options in video games
                <br>
                - Game dev is difficult so implementing new black hair style is not readily available
                <br>
                - Black hair is a Sensitive Topic
                <br>
                - Black hair was stigmatized in the past in order to dehumanize black folks during slavery
                <br>
                - Before in games like Animal Crossing, you had to tan for an amount of time to get dark skin on your character
                <br>
                - The more popular the game, the less options a player has to be "black" in the game
                <br>
                - Sometimes when in games like The Sims 4, the base game doesnt provide the sufficient hair styles, so the mod community would make them.
                <br>
                <b>Overall, Black hair in the gaming industry only recently became more widely available in options than before when the hair styles were less developed due to outside factors such as the stigmatization of black hair styles during slavery.</b>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Try pressing "a" or "f4"</p>
