      <b>The Omelas Story challenges readers to think critically on a system based on the hapinness of the collective over individual suffering</b>
      <br>
      The story questions the lines of what is good and what is evil.
      <br>
      The story of Omalas depicts a clear contrast between younger and older generations where the young would feel compassion towards the child, the older would feel nothing but contempt for it.
      The reader is left to consider how does age play a role into the perspective of others to the child.
      <br>
      The story questions the dilema of morals of ulitaranism in such a way used by Omelas.
      <br>
      The Omales story as a whole critques societies that prioritze the maximaze happiness of the greatest population number over individual suffering.
      <br>
      The Omales story implies thru the man, woman, adolescent boy, and girl who left Omales that a visit to the child led them to no longer stand the moral dilema that the city perpatrated upon itself
      and its residents.
      <br>
      It is a mystery as to how the child ended up in that inhumane basement, left to suffer for eternity.
      <br>
      The Omales story provokes question within readers on the justice and values of the people and the city.
