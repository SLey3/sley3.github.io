            <hr class="m-4" />
            <p>Loss Aversion is essentially the concept of Diminishing Marginal Utility(DMU). In human words, you feel worse about losing that money more than you feel good about gaining it as you gain more.</p>
            <p>Here are a few examples of an idea that could make money by leveraging this concept</p>

                    <ul class="list-inside list-disc">
                        <li>Players would invest a large portion of their time in Fortnite to gain skills, outfits, weapons, while sometimes investing a large amount of money as well. This would bring the value aspect of the game significantly up which would intensify the game itself. Losing as well as winning will increase the DMU significantly.</li>

                    <ul class="list-inside list-disc">
                        <li>Users deposit money into the system to try and earn some money, typically more than how much they walked in with.  When somebody wins, they get a relief of joy because they did not lose their money and ended up making money.  However, if the user loses a bet, they have the potential to lose it all.  With that, the user would feel so defeated because now they have more money.  Some people insert their life savings and attempt to win big, and when they lose it all, they now have nothing in their assets. As a company, we can make money in the long run with pinpoint statistics and have users give their money to us.  The loss aversion that we would face is losing some money on some days, or even worse, go ban  </li>

                    <ul class="list-inside list-disc">
                        <li>Loss aversion is one of the reasons people stay in unhappy relationships. The fear of losing the time, energy, and invested money, can outweigh the benefits of leaving for a potentially happier situation. With our counseling, we charge couples so we can listen to them and later give them advice on their current situation. With good advice counseling, we become a generational station.  However, we can lose everything if we give horrible advice.  So the goal is to listen, be professional, and give good advice to benefit everyone in the long run.</li>
